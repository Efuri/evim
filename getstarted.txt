The sh files have only been amateurly runned on Debian based systems. Run on your own risk and read what they do before running.

Setup:
Confirm with Nvim -version
If you do not have a modern Nvim install (Many package managers have outaded Nvim installations):
  Install latest nvim through the sh file

If you installed your Nvim now: 
  Confirm with Nvim -version
  If the version is old please try the versionfixer.sh

Place init.lua in ~/.config/nvim/init.lua

Open nvim and run:
  PackerSync
And for your lsp packages
  MasonInstall //Package to install (clangd for C languages)
